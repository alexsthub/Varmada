Before you can start developing, you will need to set up your environment. You can use this guide here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup.
We are using the React Native CLI, meaning do not following the guide for Expo. We are also targeting Android development first so when you run the project, make sure to run for android. Machines that run windows cannot develop for iOS, only android. If you are running on a Mac, even though we are only focusing on android, you will still need to install the iOS dependencies or else the application will crash on startup. <br/>
<br/>
You can run this application by either using an android emulator or your personal android device. Upon connecting a device, you can run the command, 'npx react-native run-android' and the project will start building. Make sure your emulator or your phone has an internet connection or else you will not be able to sign in and get past the login screen.<br/>
